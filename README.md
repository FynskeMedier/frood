The Frood
=========

*DISCLAIMER: This is an attempt to open source this internally used VC framework. It is not yet usable.*

*Author* [Jens Riisom Schultz](mailto:ibber_of_crew42@hotmail.com)
*Since*  2011-06-20

The Frood standardizes the VC in MVC for XOOPS.

It will help you to:

  * Add VC code to existing modules without breaking existing functionality.
  * Refactor modules to MVC.
  * Create entirely new full fledged MVC modules.
  * Communicate with other Froody modules, using MVC without the overhead and
    hassle of http requests.


Documentation
-------------

Coming soon... ;)

  * See INSTALL for installation instructions.
  * See TUTORIAL for instructions on how to code with The Frood.
  * See CHANGELOG for a change log.
