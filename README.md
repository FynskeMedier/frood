The Frood is a simple VC framework library (The VC from MVC).

It will help you to:

  * Structure your code in controllers and actions.
  * Structure your template files, in a consistent way.
  * Create entirely new full fledged (M)VC modules.
  * Communicate with other Froody modules without the overhead and hassle of http requests.


Notes
-----

  * From version 1.2.1 we have switched to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) (version 2.0.0-rc.1)


Requirements
------------

  * PHP 5.2.7+
  * You need mod_rewrite.
  * The `pecl_http` extension must be installed for HTTP remoting to work. You probably won't need this.
  * `iconv` extension is needed for action parameters with a guaranteed encoding (`string/UTF-8` and `string/ISO-8859-1`).


Documentation
-------------

Coming soon... ;)

  * See INSTALL for installation instructions.
  * See TUTORIAL for instructions on how to code with The Frood.
