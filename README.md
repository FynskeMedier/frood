The Frood
=========

*DISCLAIMER: This is an attempt to open source this internally used VC framework. It is not yet usable.*

The Frood is a simple VC framework library (The VC from MVC).

It will help you to:

  * Structure your code in controllers and actions.
  * Structure your template files, in a consistent way.
  * Create entirely new full fledged (M)VC modules.
  * Communicate with other Froody modules without the overhead and hassle of http requests.


Documentation
-------------

Coming soon... ;)

  * See INSTALL for installation instructions.
  * See TUTORIAL for instructions on how to code with The Frood.
